/**
 * A solver that provides the best fit solution for a {@link BayesianNetwork} given its constraints.
 * {@code BayesSolver} applies a variation of the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) to
 * iteratively adjust the network's distribution until it satisfies all defined constraints. After
 * solving, per-constraint error and loss results can be reviewed via {@link #getResults()}.
 *
 * <p>Two IPFP variants are currently available; a full joint-distribution procedure ({@link
 * SolverAlgorithm#SINGLE_TABLE_IPFP}), and a Junction Tree Algorithm-derived procedure ({@link
 * SolverAlgorithm#JUNCTION_TREE_IPFP}). The default variant is controlled by {@code
 * app.bayes.solver.defaultSolverAlgorithm} in {@code app.properties} (default: {@code
 * JUNCTION_TREE_IPFP}).
 *
 * <p>Additional solver properties - including the maximum number of cycles, time limits, and
 * convergence thresholds - are configurable under the {@code app.bayes.solver} section of {@code
 * app.properties}.
