/**
 * {@code InferenceEngine} provides utilities for running direct inference on a solved {@link
 * BayesianNetwork}. The values stored in the network's Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) are
 * mapped to a secondary inference network which can be queried for joint, marginal, or conditional
 * probabilities. The documentation for {@link InferenceAlgorithm} provides further information on
 * the available variants.
 *
 * <p>Specific {@link NodeState} values can be set as observed (always true) using {@link
 * #observeNetwork(Collection)} or {@link #observeNetworkFromIds(Collection)}. These will be
 * persisted in the instance until new observations are given, or until the observations are cleared
 * using {@link #resetObservations()}.
 *
 * <p>Unlike Monte Carlo sampling (as used in {@link Sampler}), which will give an approximate
 * solution, the results of direct inference are both exact and deterministic.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this interface are not thread-safe. External synchronisation is required for
 * concurrent access.
