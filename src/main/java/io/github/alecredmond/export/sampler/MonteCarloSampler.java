/**
 * A Monte Carlo sampler for a {@link BayesianNetwork} which generates random samples from the
 * network's conditional probability tables (CPTs). A {@code MonteCarloSampler} run returns a {@link
 * SampleCollection} of {@link Sample} objects. Each {@link Sample} contains a unique combination of
 * {@link NodeState} values and the frequency of its occurrence.
 *
 * <p>The only sampling algorithm currently available is <i>Likelihood Weighting Sampling (LWS)</i>.
 * LWS performs a random walk down each CPT in the {@link BayesianNetwork}, selecting each new
 * {@link NodeState} according to its weighted probability. When the algorithm reaches a {@link
 * Node} constrained to a specific {@link NodeState}, the weight of the sample is multiplied by the
 * conditional probability of that state given the sample's current configuration. At the end of the
 * run, the weighted samples are normalized and proportionally correct frequencies are assigned.
 *
 * <p>Monte Carlo sampling is a form of indirect inference. It relies on Java's built-in {@link
 * Random} functionality and does not produce exact or deterministic results. The margin of error is
 * proportional to {@code 1 / sqrt(n)}, where {@code n} is the number of samples generated.
